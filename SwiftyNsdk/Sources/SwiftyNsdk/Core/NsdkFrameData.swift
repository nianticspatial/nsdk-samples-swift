/// A complete frame of data captured from an AR session.

/// `NsdkFrameData` encapsulates all the sensor data, images, and tracking information
/// from a single AR frame. This includes camera images, depth data, device pose,
/// GPS location, compass heading, and camera intrinsics.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Frame data is the primary input to NSDK for all AR processing tasks including:
/// - Visual positioning and localization
/// - 3D scanning and reconstruction 
/// - Map building and tracking
/// - AR location positioning
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // In your ARSession delegate
/// func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate frame: ARFrame) {
///     let frameData = NsdkFrameData(
///         timestampMs: UInt64(frame.timestamp * 1000),
///         cameraImage: RawImage(from: frame.capturedImage),
///         depthImage: frame.sceneDepth?.depthMap.flatMap { RawImage(from: $0) },
///         // ... other data
///     )
///     nsdkSession.sendFrame(frameData)
/// }
/// ```
