/// Status flags for NSDK features indicating their current operational state.
///
/// `NsdkFeatureStatus` is an option set that represents various status conditions
/// for NSDK features like VPS, WPS, scanning, and mapping. Multiple status flags
/// can be active simultaneously to provide detailed status information.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Use this to monitor the health and state of NSDK features:
/// - Check for errors that need attention
/// - Monitor initialization progress
/// - Verify configuration and API key validity
/// - Ensure features are ready for operation
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let status = vpsSession.getFeatureStatus()
/// if status.contains(.badApiKey) {
///     print("Invalid API key - check your credentials")
/// } else if status.contains(.configurationFailed) {
///     print("Feature configuration failed")
/// } else if status.contains(.initializing) {
///     print("Feature is still initializing...")
/// } else if status == .ok {
///     print("Feature is ready and operational")
/// }
/// ```
