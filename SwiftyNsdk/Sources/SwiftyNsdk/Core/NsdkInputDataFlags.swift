/// Flags indicating which types of input data are required by NSDK.
///
/// `NsdkInputDataFlags` is an option set that specifies which data types
/// should be included in frames sent to NSDK. Use `getRequestedDataInputs()`
/// to determine which data is currently needed, then include only the
/// requested data types in your frame data for optimal performance.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// NSDK features dynamically request different types of input data based on:
/// - Which features are active (VPS, WPS, scanning, mapping)
/// - Current processing state and requirements
/// - Device capabilities and available sensors
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let requiredInputs = nsdkSession.getRequestedDataInputs()
/// var frameData = NsdkFrameData()
///
/// if requiredInputs.contains(.pose) {
///     frameData.cameraTransform = currentPose
/// }
/// if requiredInputs.contains(.cameraImage) {
///     frameData.cameraPlane0 = cameraPlane
/// }
/// if requiredInputs.contains(.platformDepth) {
///     frameData.depthData = depthBuffer
/// }
///
/// nsdkSession.sendFrame(frameData)
/// ```
